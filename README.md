# advanced_library_cpp
Advanced library [In progress...] 

AdvancedLibrary++ uses the QT Test framework, but you can clone this the as submodule and import the header as a normal
header only static library.

AdvancedLibrary++ is using Clang6 and Clang9 as default compilers and llvm for test coverage

Some of the structures may not compile yet, It's because it's in progress... fell free to fork it, if you like it...
I'll keep adding interesting stuff and fixing found bugs.

Thank you
